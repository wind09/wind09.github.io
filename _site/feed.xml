        <title>Billion-scale semi-supervised learning for image classification</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;bigger_p_font&quot;&gt;This paper presents a study of semi-supervised learning with large convolutional networks. We propose a pipeline, based on a teacher/student paradigm, that leverages a large collection of unlabelled images (up to 1 billion). Our main goal is to improve the performance for a given target architecture, like ResNet-50 or ResNext. We provide an extensive analysis of the success factors of our approach, which leads us to formulate some recommendations to produce high-accuracy models for image classification with semi-supervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hackathon: Build a Recipe Search Website</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;bigger_p_font&quot;&gt;In this post, we present our work for designing a receipe search website during the 1st Techbow Hackathon. The challenge lies in front-end design and good communication with backend and error handling. During the construction, we use bootstrap framework for the Html part, Vue.js + jQuery in the Javascript part and PHP as the backend server. The website is non-comercial and is only for demo use. Our responsive desgin with real-time API helped us win the champion in the hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Knowledge Aided Consistency for Weakly Supervised Phrase Grounding</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;bigger_p_font&quot;&gt;Previous methods address weakly supervised grounding by training a grounding system via learning to reconstruct language information contained in input queries from predicted proposals. Instead, we explore the consistency contained in both visual and language modalities, and leverage complementary external knowledge to facilitate weakly supervised grounding.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Query-guided Regression Network with Context Policy for Phrase Grounding</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;bigger_p_font&quot;&gt;We adopt a spatial regression method to break the performance limit, and introduce reinforcement learning techniques to further leverage semantic context information. We propose a novel Query-guided Regression network with Context policy (QRC Net) which jointly learns a Proposal Generation Network (PGN), a Query-guided Regression Network (QRN) and a Context Policy Network (CPN).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Graduation Roadtrip on Route 66</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;bigger_p_font&quot;&gt;This is my first blog on travel. I hope to share my experience on the roadtrip, which may provide useful tips for your future plan. I traveled with my roomates and friends for master graduation. We spent 7 days on the Route 66 and went through ~2/3 of USA. This experience is unique and I would like to share our plan, images and my feelings in this post (in Chinese). &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Attention guided Multi-modal Correlation Learning for Image Search</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;bigger_p_font&quot;&gt;We leverage visual and textual modalities for image search by learning their correlation with input query. According to the intent of query, attention mechanism can be introduced to adaptively balance the importance of different modalities. We propose a novel Attention guided Multi-modal Correlation (AMC) learning method which consists of a jointly learned hierarchy of intra and inter-attention networks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Attention Based Model in Visual Question Answering</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;bigger_p_font&quot;&gt;Visual question answering task (VQA) automatically generates an answer for a given image and an image-related question. Attention is of significant importance in VQA because different questions inquire about different image regions. We propose an attention model for VQA that explicitly exploits the questions to guide the attention to generate appropriate answers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Estimating the 3D Layout of Indoor Scenes and its Clutter from Depth Sensors</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;bigger_p_font&quot;&gt;In this paper we propose an approach to jointly estimate the layout of rooms as well as the clutter present in the scene using RGB-D data. Towards this goal, we propose an effective model that is able to exploit both depth and appearance features, which are complementary.  Furthermore, our approach is efficient as we exploit the inherent decomposition of additive potentials.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging NYU v2 dataset and show that employing depth reduces the layout error by 6% and the clutter estimation by 13%.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Image Super-Resolution Via Analysis Sparse Prior</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;bigger_p_font&quot;&gt;In this letter, we present a new algorithm for a single image super-resolution using the analysis sparse prior in the l-alpha-beta color space. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, due to the high scalability of our algorithm, key modules of the proposed algorithm can be integrated with other super resolution
algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
