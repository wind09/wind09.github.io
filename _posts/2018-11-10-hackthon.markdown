<p class="bigger_p_font">In this post, we present our work for designing a receipe search website during the 1st Techbow Hackathon. The challenge lies in front-end design and good communication with backend and error handling. During the construction, we use bootstrap framework for the Html part, Vue.js + jQuery in the Javascript part and PHP as the backend server. The website is non-comercial and is only for demo use. Our responsive desgin with real-time API helped us win the champion in the hackathon.</p>
