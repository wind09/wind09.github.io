<p class="bigger_p_font">This paper presents a study of semi-supervised learning with large convolutional networks. We propose a pipeline, based on a teacher/student paradigm, that leverages a large collection of unlabelled images (up to 1 billion). Our main goal is to improve the performance for a given target architecture, like ResNet-50 or ResNext. We provide an extensive analysis of the success factors of our approach, which leads us to formulate some recommendations to produce high-accuracy models for image classification with semi-supervised learning.</p>
