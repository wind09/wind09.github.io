        <h3>Hi, I'm Kan Chen!</h3>
        <p>Currently, I'm a PhD student in University of Southern California. Before that, I got my bachelor degree in Tsinghua University. My current advisor is Professor <a href="http://iris.usc.edu/people/nevatia/">Ram Nevatia</a>. I'm now doing research in computer vision, including: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Visual question answering (VQA) using deep learning </li>
            <li> Video description generation </li>
            <li> Action detection and recognition </li>
            <li> Pedestrian detection and tracking </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Recently, a lot of computer vision labs and companies are making breakthroughs in teaching machines how to "see" the world. However, the research about how to present the information from images to understandable text is still in its initial stage, which I believe will be the next key task in realizing arificial intelligence. Based on the huge amount of data from Internet, deep learning will be a strong tool to explore the possible solution.

        <p>It's the best time to talk less and do more, work hard to enjoy life.</p>
