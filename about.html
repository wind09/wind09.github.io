        <h3>Hi, I'm Kan Chen!</h3>
        <p>Currently, I'm a PhD student majoring in computer science in the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. Before that, I got my bachelor degree in <a href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/index.html">Tsinghua University</a>. My current advisor is Professor <a href="http://iris.usc.edu/people/nevatia/">Ram Nevatia</a>. I'm now doing researches in computer vision, including: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Visual question answering (VQA) using deep learning </li>
            <li> Video description generation </li>
            <li> Action detection and recognition </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Recently, a lot of computer vision labs and companies are making breakthroughs in teaching machines how to "see" the world. However, the research on how to present the information from images to understandable text is still in its initial stage, which I believe will play a more important role in realizing arificial intelligence. Utilizing the huge amount of data from the Internet, deep learning will be an effective tool to explore the possible solutions. </p>
        <p>So, let's work hard to push the limits of the future!</p>
